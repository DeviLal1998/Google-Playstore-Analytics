Task 2 focuses on extending the training project by adding an interactive geographic visualization using Plotly.
In this task, a choropleth map is created to represent global app installs by category, filtered to show only the top 5 app categories based on install count. 
Additional business rules were applied to exclude categories starting with specific characters and to highlight only categories with installs exceeding one million.

To simulate real-world enterprise dashboard control, the visualization is designed to be time-restricted, appearing only between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM IST and remaining hidden outside this window. 
This task demonstrates advanced filtering, interactive visualization, and real-time dashboard governance using the same Google Play Store dataset from the training project.
